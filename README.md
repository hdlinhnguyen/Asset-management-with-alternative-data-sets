# Asset management with alternative data sets

This side project goes over multiple application examples in academic articles to see how media drived-data can help in predicting financial market variables (trading volume, risk, future stock returns).

## Objective:
- Reproduce the result of the relevant papers, such as [Predicting Performance Using Consumer Big Data](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kenfroot/files/Predicting_Performance_Using_Consumer_Big_Data-Aug18.2021.pdf), etc; 
- Scrape, clean and explore a new dataset;
- Analyze various types of alternative datasets (such as media news) to predict the stock returns and macroeconomic indicators.

## Methods:
- Identify local markets with local media sources
- Identify trading activity by individuals in these local areas

The project uses the data from: 
- [Taxi Cab rides dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2017-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/biws-g3hs)
- [Amazon reviews dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon)
- [Uber dataset](https://kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city)
